## Instructions

### Downloading reference files
- Go to https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2586c4659ef3e7078e91168b/w/14abf4cb615429a14a2732cc/e/9ae9841864e78c02c4966c5e
- Create an account which will allow you to pull files from the website
- Download the TurtleBot 3 Burger assembly file onto your local drive
- Make sure your assembly file(s) are in a dedicated CAD folder
- Import the assembly file into SolidWorks

### Troubleshooting and rebuilding the bot
- After importing, you may face an error where SolidWorks will ask you to rebuild the file due to missing components
- Click rebuild and this will result in SolidWorks creating part files which will end up in the dedicated CAD folder
- NOTE that the assembly file downloaded from the website has the wrong waffle plate file which will require you to replace it
- The correct waffle plate files can be found in the repository for you to replace in SolidWorks Assembly
- Reference layers can also be found in the repository for you to reference or replace completely if you face any errors replacing the waffle plate
