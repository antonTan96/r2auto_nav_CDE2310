# CDE2310 Turtlebot ICBM Introduction
# Introduction
## Mission Overview
In this project, we are required to design a Turtlebot system to navigate a disaster zone maze, detect heat signals through an opaque acrylic wall, and deploy flares in a 2-4-2 pattern as a signal that the bot has reached its targets. The Turtlebot will operate without line-following capabilities and it will only be relying on sensors to navigate and perform its tasks. There will also be an added challenge, which requires the robot to scale a ramp using a 2D LiDAR.
## Problem Definition

The Maze Zone consists of 4 parts: 
- Start Zone: This is where the Turtlebot 3 will be deployed at the start of every mission.
- Randomized Maze Zone: Obstacles will be randomly placed to obstruct navigation of the Turtlebot. The Turtlebot must not run into any of the obstacles during navigation.
- Survivor Zone: This is where a heat source will be placed. The Turtlebot will have to locate a heat source in this zone and commence the flare firing sequence of 2-4-2s pattern. There are 3 Survivor Zones in the Maze Zone, with the 3rd Survivor Zone being optional to detect.
- Ramp Zone: Connected to the 3rd Survivor Zone, the Turtlebot has to scale a ramp to access the 3rd Survivor Zone. This section is optional.
	The maze zone will have the following dimensions labeled in the figure shown below:

| **Power Supply Limitations**     | The robot must operate within constraints imposed by the power source, such as the battery capacity and voltage requirements.                                                   |
| **Sensor and Actuator Limitations** | The selection and integration of sensors and actuators are constrained by factors such as cost, availability, and compatibility with the robot operating platform - ROS2   |
| **Processing Power and Memory**  | The onboard processing capabilities and memory resources of the robot system component (Raspberry Pi) are limited, affecting the complexity and efficiency of algorithms.       |
| **Environmental**                | Environmental factors such as ambient temperatures may affect sensor performance, navigation accuracy, and reliability. |
| **Cost**                         | The development and deployment of the robot system are constrained by a budget limitation of $80. Cost-effective solutions and resource prioritization are essential.         |

Building upon the Turtlebot frame, we utilise an IR Camera to identify heat sources in the maze and a spring launcher mechanism actuated by servos to launch the ping pong balls upon detection and navigation to the survivor.
